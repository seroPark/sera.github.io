                <p>
                    We conducted heuristic evaluations to identify key usability issues and synthesised findings into
                    actionable
                    items. Required documents—Consent Form, Heuristic Template, Tasks, and Prototype link—were organised
                    in
                    Figma and duplicated for each evaluator to avoid influence from others' feedback.

                            recorded for reference.</li>
                        <li>Step.3 In cases of time constraints (30-minute sessions), missing details were verbally
                            discussed and later filled in by the facilitator using the recording.</li>
                        <li>Step.4 Evaluators completed the heuristic template, rating each violation from 0–4 severity
                            (see

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Issue #1</strong> No sources to help users to understand the app’s features in a
                        sensitive
                        mental health community platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Issue #2</strong>: Not enough options presented for users throughout the app (including
                        media files, dropdown & filtering).</li>
                    <li><strong>Issue #3</strong>: Users are overwhelmed at the clustered look of the page from visual
                        elements to small texts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Issue #4</strong>: Users are unsure about whether their posting has been successful,
                        where
                        their post will go & who can see their post.</li>
                    <li><strong>Issue #5</strong>: Many features/elements are repetitive and confuses users.</li>

                <h2>User-Based Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    To gain deeper insights into how users interact with the refined prototype, we used a triangulation
                    approach
                    that
                    combined observation, interviews, and surveys. This method revealed both usability issues and
                    opportunities
                    for improvement by capturing user behaviour, thoughts, and feedback.

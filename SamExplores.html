                    Sam Explores was conceptualised to tackle the global challenge of delivering comprehensive sexual
                    education. Guided by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education), our
                    team
                    developed an accessible and engaging tool to equip children and their parents with the knowledge and
                    skills essential for healthy development.

                        overcoming these obstacles?</li>
                    <li>How can we enhance parental knowledge and understanding of the value of comprehensive sexuality

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>To gain a deep understanding of the problem space and user needs, we conducted comprehensive research
                through three distinct methods: questionnaires, online ethnography, and interviews. Each method was
                chosen to address specific aspects of the research question while capturing diverse perspectives.

                    <h3>Online Ethnography</h3>
                    <p>By observing discussions on platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and ReachOut, we
                        explored <strong><mark class=highlightme>unfiltered conversations around sexual

                        This method allowed us to identify recurring themes, <strong>cultural attitudes</strong>, and
                        the <strong>influence of stigma or shame</strong> in online communities.
